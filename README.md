#AI-Alogrithms
### These are non deep learning based AI programs.

## Sudoku
### This is a Diagonal Sudoku Solver using constraint propagation to solve the naked twins problem. Refer the project readme for details

## Isolation
### In this project, We will develop an adversarial search agent to play the game "Isolation". Isolation is a deterministic, two-player game of perfect information in which the players alternate turns moving a single piece from one cell to another on a board. Whenever either player occupies a cell, that cell becomes blocked for the remainder of the game. The first player with no remaining legal moves loses, and the opponent is declared the winner.

## Planning search
### This project includes skeletons for the classes and functions needed to solve deterministic logistics planning problems for an Air Cargo transport system using a planning search agent. With progression search algorithms like those in the navigation problem from lecture, optimal plans for each problem will be computed. Unlike the navigation problem, there is no simple distance heuristic to aid the agent.
## Pacman search
### Help Pac-Man navigate his world in the most efficient way to find food and other objects by implementing BFS, DFS, and A* Search
